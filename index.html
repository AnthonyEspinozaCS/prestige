                    Daniel S. Peña, Sr. is a titan in business and finance, with a career spanning several decades and a proven track record of achieving quantum growth for his companies.

                      Before founding TGG, Peña served as Chairman, President, and CEO of Great Western Resources Inc. (GWRI), a Houston-based natural resource company public on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Under Peña's leadership, GWRI grew from
                      just $820 to a massive $450 million in eight years, achieving an astounding growth rate of 542,000% during one of the worst energy market collapses in history. This remarkable achievement has made him a quantum growth strategist
                      with a unique ability to create exponential growth even in the most challenging circumstances.

                      entities such as the Vatican and the Los Angeles Police Protective League. He has also taught pro bono courses on entrepreneurship to minority business students at California State University, where he graduated with a BS in
                      Business Administration in 1971.

                    <p>
                      In addition to his business and philanthropic endeavors, Peña is an accomplished sportsman, having received several awards for his achievements in golf and other athletic pursuits. He splits his time between Manila, Monte Carlo,
                      and the UK, where he spends summers and holidays with his three grown children at their stunning 15th Century estate, Guthrie Castle, in Scotland. Peña and his children enjoy playing golf on their private course and working out
                      in their fully equipped fitness facility.
