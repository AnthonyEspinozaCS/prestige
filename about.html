                  In addition to his business and philanthropic endeavors, Peña is an accomplished sportsman, having received several awards for his achievements in golf and other athletic pursuits. He splits his time between Manila, Monte Carlo, and
                  the UK, where he spends summers and holidays with his three grown children at their stunning 15th Century estate, Guthrie Castle, in Scotland. Peña and his children enjoy playing golf on their private course and working out in their
