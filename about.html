            <p>
              We are delighted to announce the esteemed contributions of Teresa Griffiths CBE and Dr. Gwenllian Hughes MBE to our organisation. Each brings a profound depth of experience and a considerable breadth of knowledge within the healthcare
              industry. Of particular note is their active involvement in healthcare-related projects and their contributions at the UK Government level, both of which significantly enhance the collective proficiency of our organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Tim Tran, a licensed and highly reputable physician, is another key contributor to our team. He maintains an unwavering commitment to the ethical provision of patient care, consistently delivering services of an unparalleled
              standard. It is this unwavering devotion to honesty, dignity, and integrity that engenders profound trust from his patients and exemplifies the ethos of our organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leading the corporate facet of our board is Mr Dan Peña, the recipient of the Order of St. John, a distinction bestowed by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Mr Peña’s experience spans over five decades, during which he has demonstrated
              extraordinary prowess in concluding high-stakes, international deals. Accumulating over a trillion US dollars in equity through diverse global projects, he graciously commits his extensive expertise to our UK-based endeavour.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Finance Director, Francis Martin CBE, who formerly served as the Managing Partner of BDO NI and the immediate past President of the British Chambers of Commerce, lends his remarkable acumen to our team. Notably, he was the recipient
              of the "Deal Maker of the Year" award in 2016, an accolade that speaks volumes about his proficiency in concluding impactful transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, we are privileged to have Fiona Hobbs, our Legal Director hailing from the distinguished London firm, Linklaters. Fiona brings an impressive wealth of expertise in handling intricate legal matters, ensuring the successful
              conclusion of transactions. It is noteworthy to mention that both Francis and Fiona possess previous experience providing advisory services at the UK Government level, further strengthening our organisation's collective competency.
